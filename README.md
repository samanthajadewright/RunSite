# Project Name

Welcome to my project! This was a learning experience for me as I worked through the **Code Institute** curriculum. Many of the skills I applied here were developed using a **copy-and-repeat** approach, allowing me to understand coding principles by following structured examples and gradually adapting them to my own work.

## About the Project

The goal of this website was to create something **basic, functional, and easy to navigate**. I wanted users to be able to quickly find the information they need without unnecessary complexity. Simplicity and usability were key guiding principles during development.

### Features
- **Clean and Simple UI** – No clutter, just straightforward navigation.
- **Easy Access to Information** – The website presents information in an intuitive way.
- **Beginner-Friendly Code** – Since this was part of my learning journey, the code is written in a way that other beginners might find easy to follow.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS


## Lessons Learned
Throughout this project, I practiced:
- Structuring HTML for better readability.
- Styling with CSS to ensure a clean layout.


## Acknowledgments
A big thanks to **Code Institute** for providing the resources and structured learning path that helped me develop this project.
