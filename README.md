# 🚀 Project Name

Welcome to my project! 🎉 This has been an exciting and challenging learning journey where I applied many of the skills I developed through the Code Institute curriculum. The approach I used to build this project was a mix of copying examples and then tweaking them to fit my understanding and goals, helping me grasp coding principles deeply.

##  About the Project

The goal of this website was to create something **simple**, **functional**, and **user-friendly**. I focused on making it easy for users to find the information they need without unnecessary complexity. **Simplicity** and **usability** were the main principles I followed during development.

##  Features

| Feature                       | Description                                      |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 🎨 **Clean and Simple UI**     | A straightforward design with no clutter, making navigation intuitive. |
| 📄 **Easy Access to Information** | Information is presented clearly and in an easy-to-find manner. |
| 💡 **Beginner-Friendly Code**  | Code is written with simplicity and clarity to help others who are just starting out. |

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **🏗 HTML** – The backbone of the website, used for structuring content.
- **🎨 CSS** – Styling for a clean and professional layout.

## 🚀 Lessons Learned

This project has been a huge learning curve for me, and I've gained valuable experience. Some key takeaways include:

- **Structuring HTML** for better readability and maintainability.
  - **Using CSS** to create visually appealing and consistent design elements.
-  **Debugging and problem-solving**: While there were frustrating moments, overcoming them brought a huge sense of accomplishment! I particulalrly struggled initially with the gallery and layout.

## 🔄 What I'd Improve

If I were to work on this project again, here’s what I’d love to enhance:

- ✨ **Add JavaScript** to introduce interactive features and enhance the user experience.
- 🎨 **Refine the design** to make it even more visually engaging and unique.
- 📱 **Improve responsiveness** so the site looks great on all devices.
